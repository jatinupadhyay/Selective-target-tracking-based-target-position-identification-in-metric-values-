# Selective-target-tracking-based-target-position-identification-in-metric-values

These codes are used to track objects based on their selection. The code was tested on a raspberry pi board and a pi zero camera configuration with a 4000 mAh battery. 

The code's purpose is to identify the target from the drone and calculate the exact distance and angle from the drone's centre. 

This code can be used for a variety of purposes, such as precision landing on a moving target, drone movement with target movement, and so on. Please take it in a positive light. 

I AM NOT LIABLE IF THE CODE IS USED IN ANY DESTRUCTIVE ACTIVITY. 

The calculation is described in detail in my paper "Multiple Drone Navigation and Formation Using Selective Target Tracking-Based Computer Vision.":

Please cite my paper if you utilised my code.

Thank you
